# Simple tic tac toe
A simple game created for an assignment.
Game is rendered using notcurses, a TUI rendering library in c


## Compatibility notes 
libnotcurses is not fully compatible with Windows, and its functionality is limited when used with Windows ConHost. 
For the best experience, it's recommended to use Linux. \
During development and testing, the application was run using WSL, but due to the limitations of Windows ConHost, the color display was not as vibrant as desired.
